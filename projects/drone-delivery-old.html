            <h2 class="section-title animate-on-scroll">Technical Implementation</h2>
            <div class="section-content animate-on-scroll">
                The project architecture is built around three core classes: Node (representing navigable points in 3D space), City (managing environment data and algorithms), and Drone (handling altitude constraints and navigation capabilities). The system processes real 3D building data from Paris, converting complex meshes into navigable point clouds while maintaining spatial relationships.
            </div>
            
            <div class="section-content animate-on-scroll">
                Key technical achievements include implementing optimized A* and Dijkstra algorithms with priority queue management, developing a TSP solver for multi-point route optimization, and creating seamless integration between 2D Pygame visualization and 3D Open3D rendering. The system handles permutation analysis for delivery route optimization and provides comparative analysis between aerial and ground-based navigation.

            <h2 class="section-title animate-on-scroll">Research Results</h2>
            <div class="section-content animate-on-scroll">
                The project demonstrates that A* algorithm consistently outperforms Dijkstra for drone path planning due to its heuristic approach. Drone delivery achieves significantly shorter routes compared to ground vehicles, especially in dense urban environments. The research shows that 3D navigation constraints have a major impact on optimal route selection, and multi-stop delivery requires sophisticated ordering optimization to achieve true efficiency.
            </div>
            
            <div class="section-content animate-on-scroll">
                Performance analysis reveals that altitude-based constraints can reduce delivery distances by up to 40% compared to ground-based routing, while the TSP optimization component ensures minimal total travel distance for multi-point deliveries. The visualization system provides clear insights into algorithm behavior and route efficiency metrics.
