            <div class="section-content animate-on-scroll">
                Traditional event planning relies on scattered communication across multiple platforms - WhatsApp for messaging, separate apps for expense splitting, email for invitations, and yet another service for photo sharing. This fragmentation leads to confusion, missed messages, and inefficient coordination.
