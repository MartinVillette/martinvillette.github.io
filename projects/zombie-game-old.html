            <div class="section-content animate-on-scroll">
                This zombie survival game was developed during summer holidays as a hands-on learning experience with C++ programming and game development. The project focuses on fundamental concepts like pointer management, object-oriented design, and real-time graphics rendering using the SDL2 library. Players navigate through a procedurally generated world while fighting off intelligent zombies that use pathfinding algorithms to hunt them down.

            <div class="section-content animate-on-scroll">
                This project served as a stepping stone toward building more complex AI systems. The ultimate goal was to gain sufficient C++ experience to later develop an AI village simulation where multiple AI agents (villagers) would interact autonomously within a shared environment, each with their own behaviors and decision-making capabilities.

                The game architecture follows object-oriented principles with a clear inheritance hierarchy. The Human base class is extended by both Player and Zombie classes, promoting code reuse and maintainability. The Window class manages SDL2 rendering and event handling, while the Map class handles world generation and entity management.

                Key technical achievements include implementing A* pathfinding for zombie navigation, dynamic lighting effects using SDL2 blend modes, collision detection systems, and efficient memory management with proper pointer usage. The project demonstrates practical application of C++ concepts in a real-time interactive environment.

                This zombie game serves as the foundation for a more ambitious project: an AI village simulation. The experience gained from building intelligent zombie behavior, pathfinding systems, and entity management will be applied to create autonomous villagers with complex behaviors, social interactions, and emergent gameplay scenarios.

                The planned AI village will feature multiple AI agents (villagers) that autonomously navigate the world, perform tasks, interact with each other, and respond to environmental changes. Each villager will have unique personalities, goals, and decision-making processes, creating a living, breathing virtual community.
